## 📘 Introduction

Machine learning projects typically follow a **three-step process**:
1. Data Pre-processing  
2. Modeling  
3. Evaluation  

Each of these stages plays a critical role in ensuring that your model performs effectively and produces meaningful results.

## 🧹 Step 1: Data Pre-processing
In this phase, we:
- **Import the data**  
- **Clean and prepare it** for analysis  
- **Split it** into training and test sets  

> **Note:** In this course, we use *pre-cleaned datasets* to focus on other key aspects of machine learning.  
> However, in real-world scenarios, **data cleaning** is a vital step to ensure data quality and accuracy.

## 🤖 Step 2: Modeling
Once the data is ready, we move to the **modeling phase**, which involves:
- **Building** the model  
- **Training** it with the training data  
- **Making predictions** on new or unseen data  

This is often the most engaging part of the process, as it allows you to explore different algorithms and refine your modeling skills.

## 📊 Step 3: Evaluation
The final step is to **evaluate** the model’s performance.  
This includes:
- Calculating **performance metrics** (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score)  
- Assessing **model fit** and **effectiveness**  
- Ensuring the model meets the intended purpose  

Model evaluation helps determine whether your approach generalizes well to new data and supports decision-making effectively.

## 🧭 Conclusion
The machine learning process is an iterative and structured approach consisting of:
1. **Data Pre-processing**
2. **Modeling**
3. **Evaluation**

By practicing these steps hands-on, you’ll gain a deeper understanding of how machine learning models are built, trained, and assessed in real-world applications.
